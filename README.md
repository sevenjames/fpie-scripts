# fpie-scripts
Scripts for use with FreePIE, the Programmable Input Emulator.

https://github.com/AndersMalmgren/FreePIE

## Performance
FreePIE scripts automatically loop too fast.

This is managed in these scripts with a frame limiter.

## Hardware Reference
```
Inputs for Logitech F310 gamepad:
left stick LR = x axis, left stick UD = y axis
right stick LR = x rotation, right stick UD = y rotation
left trigger = +z axis, right trigger = -z axis
```
